The file `bsml.cfr` defines the complete family of Big-Step Modeling Languages from [Day & Atlee 2010](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0102-z). It is taken from the feature diagrams for syntactic and semantic variations, and the additional constraints listed in the paper.

It serves as input to the **Clafer** ([github](https://github.com/gsdlab/clafer)) tool. Clafer compiles this to several  formats, one of which is the input format of **ChocoSolver** ([github](https://github.com/gsdlab/chocosolver)), which can automatically generate instances.
