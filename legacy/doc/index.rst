SCCD Documentation
==================

SCCD [SCCD]_ is a language that combines the Statecharts [Statecharts]_ language with Class Diagrams. It allows users to model complex, timed, autonomous, reactive, dynamic-structure systems.

The concrete syntax of SCCD is an XML-format loosely based on the `W3C SCXML recommendation <https://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/>`_. A conforming model can be compiled to a number of programming languages, as well as a number of runtime platforms implemented in those languages. This maximizes the number of applications that can be modelled using SCCD, such as user interfaces, the artificial intelligence of game characters, controller software, and much more.

This documentation serves as an introduction to the SCCD language, its compiler, and the different supported runtime platforms.
