Notes about the future of SCCD
==============================

Long-term vision:

  - execute SCCD models in web browsers
    - through supporting JavaScript (or TypeScript) as:
        - a port of the runtime
        - a target language
    - through supporting C as target language, and compiling to WebAssembly

  - dynamic creation/destruction of instances (the "CD" part of SCCD)

  - graphical editing of statecharts
    - most likely in diagrams.net ("drawio")
        - convert drawio (XML) models to SCCDXML
        - statechart editing plugin

  - code generation
    - generating portable C code may be the most flexible option:
      - compile to WebAssembly
      - call from Python, Java, ...

  - improve statechart "interface" definition: in/out event, variables (+ observers?), functions, objects
    -> YAKINDU as inspiration

  - testing framework
     - support white-box testing
     - more expressive test models (like YAKINDU's SCTUNIT)
