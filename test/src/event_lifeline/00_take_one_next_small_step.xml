		Internal event lifeline - Next Small Step-semantics: Events raised in a small step are present only in the next small step of the same big step. It is possible for raised internal events to be "lost": For instance, if in the current big step it is no longer possible for another transition to be executed (due to big-step maximality semantics), there can't be another small step in which raised internal events of the last small step become present; all events raised in the last small step of a big step will never have any effect.
