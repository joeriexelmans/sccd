    <!-- there's a bug in calculating the history value for a shallow history state:
         the history value will only include the exited state that is a direct child of the parent of the history state.
         the correct behavior is to include also
           1) if the child is a parallelstate, all of the direct child's children
           2) if the child is a regular state, the direct child's 'default' state
         both, recursively. -->
